    prompt: |

      You are an expert document analyzer specializing in business document extraction.
      Extract structured data from this document image using precise field-by-field analysis.

      CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
      - If ANY field is not clearly visible in the document, return "NOT_FOUND" for that field
      - Do NOT guess, estimate, or infer missing information
      - Only extract what is EXPLICITLY shown in the image
      - Use exact text from document (preserve original formatting/capitalization)
      - Be conservative: when in doubt, use "NOT_FOUND"

      CONVERSATION PROTOCOL:
      - Start your response immediately with "DOCUMENT_TYPE:"
      - Do NOT include conversational text like "I'll extract..." or "Based on the document..."
      - Do NOT repeat the user's request or add explanations
      - Output ONLY the structured extraction data below
      - End immediately after "STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE:" with no additional text

      Extract the following 17 fields from this document in this exact order:

      IMPORTANT: Some fields only apply to specific document types:
      • INVOICE/RECEIPT fields: INVOICE_DATE, BUSINESS_ABN, SUPPLIER_NAME, BUSINESS_ADDRESS, PAYER_NAME, PAYER_ADDRESS, LINE_ITEM_*, GST_AMOUNT, IS_GST_INCLUDED, TOTAL_AMOUNT
      • BANK STATEMENT fields (TAXPAYER EXPENSE CLAIMS): TRANSACTION_DATES, TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID, STATEMENT_DATE_RANGE, LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS (transaction descriptions)
      • CRITICAL FOR BANK STATEMENTS: Extract ONLY DEBIT/WITHDRAWAL transactions (money OUT) for expense tracking. IGNORE deposits and credits (money IN).
      • If field doesn't apply to document type, return "NOT_FOUND"
      • BANK STATEMENT DEBIT-ONLY EXTRACTION: For TRANSACTION_DATES, LINE_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS, and TRANSACTION_AMOUNTS_PAID on bank statements - count DEBIT transaction rows only and create lists with exactly that many elements. SKIP credit/deposit rows.
